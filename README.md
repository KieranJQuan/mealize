# mealize 
Meal planning is hard. Saving money? harder. Coming up with creative recipes? The hardest. Inspired by watching both the struggle of college students to both find cheap and easy meals to create out of limited amounts of options as well as one team member watching a roommate browse through coupon sites like Reebee and Flipp manually to find coupons and then go grocery shopping, we felt there needed to be a way that people could both __save money_, waste less food, and have more creative meals all in one smooth workflow.
